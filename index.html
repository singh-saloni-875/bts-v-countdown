        <h2>A Birthday countdown of BTS V
            <br>
            Happy Birthday to the man who is fluent in two languages: Korean and Truth. <br>
            A man with a kind heart and unmatched empathy.<br>
            A man with a golden character and a deep, captivating voice.<br>
            A man brimming with talent, adorned with a charming smile.<br>
            A man destined to share his journey with his soulmate, Jimin.<br>
            A man with a perfect face and an exceptional understanding of people.<br>
            A man who radiates kindness and inspires others to "live your life with happiness."<br>
            A man whose heart belongs to BTS, who stands as the face of Korea.<br>
            A man who played a pivotal role in making BTS a global phenomenon (fight me on this, even RM said so!).<br>
            A man who can sing, dance, model, and would excel as an officer in military service.<br>
            A man with 0% arrogance, who loves his bandmates deeply.<br>
            A man whom everyone admires once they meet him (just ask Jackie Chan!).<br>

            Kim Taehyung, you are truly one of a kind.Â HappyÂ Birthday!
